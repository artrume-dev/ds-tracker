As a Design system lead, I want to build a Design Tokens usage tracker dashboard so I can: 

1- Track which teams, and digital channels are using our design tokens. 

2- Track digital channels that are using our design tokens in their own website or app. 

3- Track the number of patterns other digital channels are using from our Canon Design System  

4- Track and see how many token used in the pattern and their dependancy 

5- See design system contributor name and email 

6- Notify all team when any token values update through email or dashboard notification area 

7- Provde other teams areview and accept option for all incoming changes from Canon design system 

8- provide a deployment option of the incoming updates to their test environment first before other team release the incoming changes to their production

Basic token usage scanner
